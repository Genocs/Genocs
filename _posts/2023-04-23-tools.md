## Design

Sequence diagrams are a type of UML diagram used to show the sequence of interactions between objects in a system. They are used to illustrate the order of events and the relationships between them, as well as the messages that are exchanged between objects. Sequence diagrams can be used to model the flow of control in a system, and are often used to help design and debug software.
